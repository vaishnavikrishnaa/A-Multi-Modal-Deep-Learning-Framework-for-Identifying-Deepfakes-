I want you to generate a complete full-stack web application called DeepFake Detection, built on Replit, with the following requirements:

🔵 APP PURPOSE

The application should allow a user to upload:

Images

Videos

The backend must analyze the uploaded media and predict whether it is real or fake, and return:

The prediction (Real / Fake)

The accuracy/confidence score (%)

A short explanation of the model’s reasoning

🔵 FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS

Create a very beautiful, modern, responsive UI using React + TailwindCSS or HTML/CSS/JS (your choice).

Include:

1. Landing Page

Title: DeepFake Detection

A hero section with animations

A small paragraph:
✔ What DeepFake Detection is
✔ Why DeepFake detection is needed
✔ Risks of deepfakes in society
✔ How the model works

2. Upload Page

Upload image or video

Show preview

A “Scan for DeepFake” button (stylish)

3. Results Page

Show:

Uploaded media

Label (REAL or FAKE)

Accuracy %

Progress bar animation

Text-based explanation

Beautiful cards, gradients, animations

🔵 BACKEND REQUIREMENTS

Backend must be built using FastAPI (Python).

Features:

Endpoint to upload image

Endpoint to upload video

Run deepfake detection model

Send JSON response with:

label: real/fake

confidence score

reasoning text

🔵 ML MODEL REQUIREMENTS

Implement a model pipeline that uses:

Six reinforcement learning techniques (for improved detection)

Use these RL algorithms:

DQN

Double DQN

Dueling DQN

PPO

A3C

REINFORCE

These must be used for:

Frame selection

Temporal pattern learning

Improving the classifier's accuracy

Unsupervised learning

Use:

Autoencoders

Variational Autoencoders (VAE)

K-means for anomaly detection

PCA for dimensionality reduction

These must help:

Extract facial features

Detect unnatural patterns

Improve prediction accuracy

(If training from scratch takes too long, use pretrained models + integrate RL/unsupervised layers.)

🔵 DATABASE REQUIREMENTS

Include a working database using SQLite or PostgreSQL.

Store:

Upload history

Filename

User ID (dummy)

Prediction result

Confidence score

Timestamp

Important:

Create migrations

Include DB models

🔵 STRUCTURE THE PROJECT

Create this folder structure:

/deepfake-detection
    /frontend
    /backend
        main.py
        models/
        routers/
        utils/
        database.py
        ml/

🔵 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Provide a README.md

Include installation + running instructions for Replit

Allow cross-origin communication (CORS)

Include sample test images/videos

🔵 FINAL EXPECTATION

At the end, output:

✔ Complete React frontend code
✔ Complete FastAPI backend code
✔ ML model code (RL + Unsupervised)
✔ Database models
✔ API routes
✔ Instructions to run everything on Replit
